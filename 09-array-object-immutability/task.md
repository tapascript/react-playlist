## Tasks

Thank you for watching and learning. Here are the tasks for you:

- In the movie watcher app, we haven't implemented the filtering capability. Please build it. I have pushed the code for it so that you can refer to it only when you are stuck. Please try implementing it without seeing first.
- Make sure all the selection and updates to the state is stored in browser's localstorage. If user refreshed the page or come back later, the selection should be persisted.
- Once done, write a good readme of your project, deploy it, and share the project reposrioty link, and deployed URL link on Discord(React e Hatekhori's task channel.)
